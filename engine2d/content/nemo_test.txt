It's a little story about how my dad goes looking for me in the Great Barrier Reef when I was just a wee little clown fish. TL;DR is I wanted to go out exploring the great unknown because my dad, Marlin, was kinda an overprotective clown fish (mom died when I was just an egg). So I did what every angsty 6-year-old would do. Swim off by myself and explore the mysterious reef! I met so many cool people on my journey, but was honestly super happy my dad found me. Now I'm 16 years old, all grown up, and ready for my next adventure! Dad isn't as protective anymore, but he still wants me to be safe. Help me find the great treasure of the barrier reef!

said, “with a piece of Uncle Bruce around your neck, you'll be safe”.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Option: Give Spoon or Give Magnifying Glass or Give Shark Tooth

Crush: That's a song for sure, but the song doesn't radiate sun glistening in the ocean
cool vibes… How about a song that has to do with the beautiful reef around us?
Sing “Lilo & Stitch - Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride”:
Crush: *Bobs head back and forth* That… That was…
Squirt: AWESOME
Crush: *Nods* That was as Squirt said, awesome
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Magnifying Glass:
Crush: A magnifying glass? I'm no Sherlock Holmes, my little Nemo, but I must say this
is a cool tabernacle you have here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shark Tooth:
Crush: Woah Nemo, where'd you get this? It looks like a Great White's tooth, pretty rare
around these parts.

treasure!

were passing some sunken pirate ship and this box was just vibin at the bow of the ship.
Oh yeah. This is the one.

inside? Let's figure out how to open it!

Nemo: Uncle Bruce? He's scary, but as long as you don't bleed in front of him, he's the
best uncle. He is this GIANT great-white, but he doesn't eat fish. Sustainability for our
reef is his motto.
## At Bruce's ##
Bruce: *mumbles in sleep* fish are friends, not food
Nemo: Uncle Bruce. Uncle Bruce! Wake up!
Bruce: *opens one eye* Nemo! How is my favorite clown fish nephew doing!
Nemo: Hi Uncle Bruce, this is my friend (User)
Bruce: Quite the fish you are. Oh Nemo you've grown so much! What are you doing
here? Uncle Anchor and Chum are sleeping in the next room. Would you like me to
wake them?
Nemo: No it's okay Uncle Bruce, we're here to ask you if you would know about a map
that would lead us to a treasure in the reef.
Bruce: A treasure? What kind of treasure you say?
User Option: Superpowers / A Killer Whale / Blackbeard's Treasure / Captain Jack
Sparrow's Pirate Hat
A Killer Whale:
A Killer Whale? You small little fish are better off searching for a giant pot of gold in the
deep sea. Which reminds me, how are Marlin and Dory doing?Nemo: They're doing just great Uncle Bruce! Cmon (User), tell him what we're REALLY
here for!
Blackbeard's Treasure eh? All the great treasures of the sea begin and end with me, the
LEGENDARY GREAT WHITE. Which reminds me, how are Marlin and Dory doing?

here for!
Superpowers:
Bruce: Ah, you're looking for the “tesoro del arrecife”.
Anchor: Did someone say “tesoro del arrecife”?
Chum: “tesoro del arrecife”?
Bruce: Boys, our nephew Nemo and friend er, (User), here are looking for “tesoro del
arrecife”.
Anchor: Oh Nemo, the “tesoro del arrecife”, is but a childhood myth!
Chum: *Nods*
Bruce: *Floats Pensively*
Nemo: What are you thinking about Uncle Bruce?
Bruce: Well my boy, it USED to be but a myth. “tesoro del arrecife” is real, and I've
seen it myself.
Anchor & Chum: What?!?
Bruce: Before I founded the fish-friendly shart support group, I journeyed to the deep
reef, and I saw the “tesoro del arrecife” with my own eyes. But alas, I was blinded by a
large school of fish, and went to eat them all.
Nemo: It's okay Uncle Bruce, everyone makes mistakes! It's who we are now that's
important. Hey (User), give Uncle Bruce a gift to make him feel better, maybe he'll let us
know how to get to that treasure if he's happy!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Option: Give Spoon / Give Magnifying Glass / Give Shark Tooth

Cum on Feel the Noize” / Sing “Kelly Clarkson - Since You've Been Gone”
Sing “Quiet Riot - Cum on Feel the Noize”:

calming
Sing “Kelly Clarkson - Since You've Been Gone”:
Bruce: That's a song for sure, but the song makes me feel a bit, angry… How about a
song that has to do with friendship? Like you and Nemo.
Sing “Randy Newman - You've Got a Friend in Me”:
Bruce: *Bobs head back and forth* That… That was…
Anchor & Chum: Beautiful
Bruce: *Nods* That was as said, beautiful *holding back tears*

Bruce: I'm… I'm so… happy. Thank you Nemo. But you should keep this with you like
Marlin says.

Bruce: I found this box when I was exploring a sunken pirate ship. It's actually where I
met your Uncle Anchor and Chum.
Anchor & Chum: That was this? Why'd you never tell us Bruce?
Bruce: Worry not, I'll explain everything when the lads leave.
Nemo: Thanks Uncle Bruce! Hey (User), what does it say on the box? Is the map
inside? Let's figure out how to open it!
Bruce: Good luck my little ones…

Nemo: Well (User). Now we have a box. But no map. How do we even know this box is
right?
User Option: Inspect Box / Explore the Ocean
Explore the Ocean:
Nemo: Exploring the ocean doesn't really get us anywhere now. Try to think of
something better we can do with this box!
Inspect Box:
Nemo: You're right. We should take a closer look at the box.
*carefully inspects box*
Nemo: Look (User)! It says, “treasure of the reef” with a lock on one side and there's a
riddle on the other side! Let's read what the riddle says.
Riddle: “I am a ship that can be made to ride the greatest waves. I am not built by tool,
but built by hearts and minds. What am I?”
Nemo: What could the answer be?
User Option: Friendship / Love / Family / Pirate Ship
Love:
Nemo: Love doesn't work. The box is still locked. Let's try again.Family:
Nemo: Oh, good answer! Dangit, it still doesn't work.
Pirate Ship:
Silly “user”, pirate ships are built by tools!
Friendship:
Nemo: “Friendship” you say? That might work! Try putting it into the alphabet lock!
*Click* *Clack*
Hey, that worked! Oh (User), I'm so happy we became friends and went on this
adventure together. Let's open the box now! What's inside?
User Option: Grab map
Grab Map:
Nemo: What does it say?
MAP: Picture of Mirror
Nemo: It's just… It's just a mirror? Is there nothing else?
User Option: Inspect Mirror
Inspect Mirror:
Engraved into the bottom corner of the mirror
“The greatest treasure is not visible by eye. It is rather found in the heart”
Nemo: Hey (User). It's us in the mirror. Do you think…
Nemo: The super power we were looking for… Maybe it's not a superpower, but it's the
friendships we made along the way, that make us feel extraordinary…
